# CodeKata-Starter
C# Starter template for a dotnet core class lib and xunit framework to run a TDD dojo

To Start:
1) Clone this repo to your local machine.
2) Open in a your favourite code editor.
3) In a terminal, navigate to the /test/ dir.

To Run tests:
dotnet test

Dojo structure
1) Write a failing test
2) Pass onto the next person
3) Write the minimum amount of code to make all the tests pass
4) When the test(s) pass refactor your code.
5) Repeat.


Troubleshooting

- The test should run and fail the first time you open the project. The test should not fail due to compliation errors.
- Make sure you have the C# extension enabled (VSCode).
- Restore Dependencies when prompted.
